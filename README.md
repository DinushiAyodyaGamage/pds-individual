# Industrial Accident
## Overview of the project
Workplace safety is a critical concern across industries, and data-driven approaches can play a vital role in preventing accidents and protecting employees. This report presents an analysis of a dataset from IHM Stefanini (IHM), a Brazilian company, which details industrial accidents in 12 manufacturing sites across three countries. The dataset includes a variety of features, ranging from accident severity and location to employee demographics and detailed incident descriptions. 
This analysis employs a comprehensive methodology, starting with data collection and preparation, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, coupled with insightful visualizations, are used to uncover patterns and trends within the data. Furthermore, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is applied to the accident descriptions to extract valuable information about the causes and contributing factors. The ultimate goal of this report is to provide actionable insights and recommendations that can help reduce the risk of industrial accidents and improve workplace safety.
